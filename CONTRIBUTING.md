# Contributing to C³ (Causal Experience Memory)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **C³** 🎉  
All contributions — code, design feedback, benchmarks, and criticism — are welcome.

C³ is an open-source systems project focused on building a **lightweight, causal memory layer** for AI and agentic systems. The goal is correctness, simplicity, and production readiness over hype.

## How You Can Contribute

There are many ways to help, even if you don’t want to write a lot of code.

### 1. Core C++ Development
Help improve the C++ memory engine:
- performance optimizations
- memory safety
- data structure improvements
- concurrency / sharding ideas
- persistence design

### 2. Language Bindings
Help make C³ easy to adopt:
- Python bindings (thin, safe API)
- JavaScript / Node bindings
- WASM experiments
- C API design

### 3. Benchmarks & Evaluation
Help validate C³ in realistic scenarios:
- agent simulations
- failure suppression benchmarks
- GenAI / RAG / tool-using workflows
- reproducible experiments

### 4. Documentation
Help improve:
- README clarity
- examples
- diagrams
- usage guides
- blog-style explanations

### 5. Design Feedback
Push back on assumptions:
- what C³ should or should not do
- edge cases
- limitations
- comparisons with other paradigms

Thoughtful criticism is a contribution.
